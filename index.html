        <h1>Hello, I'm Ethel.</h1>
        <p>I'm a digital product designer based in Singapore. I stumbled into the field of tech and design by chance, and have never looked back since. Being a designer feeds my curiosities, helps me explore many different facets of life and allows me to have a broader understanding of how our world works. </p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy googling about whatever comes to my mind, learning about cars, grilling meats, constructing LEGOs, running and being an aquatic hobbyist. Basically, I enjoy tinkering around with my hands and solving problems one step at a time.</p></td>
